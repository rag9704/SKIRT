    /** This function drives the dust self-absorption phase in a panchromatic Monte Carlo
        simulation. This function consists of a big loop, which represents the different cycles of
        the dust self-absorption phase. This outer loop, and the function, terminates when either
        the maximum number of dust self-absorption iterations has been reached (the hardcoded value
        is 100), or when the total luminosity absorbed by the dust is stable and does not change by
        more than 0.5% compared to the previous cycle. Within every cycle, the first task is to
        construct the dust emission library that describes the spectral properties of the dust
        emission. Subsequently the dust self-absorption phase implements a parallelized loop that
        iterates over \f$N_{\text{pp}}\times N_\lambda\f$ monochromatic photon packages. Within
        this loop, the function simulates the life cycle of a single dust photon package. Before we
        can start the life cycle of the photon packages at a given wavelength index \f$\ell\f$, we
        first have to determine the total luminosity that is emitted from every dust cell at that
        wavelength index. This is just the product of the total luminosity absorbed in the
        \f$m\f$'th dust cell, \f$L^{\text{abs}}_m\f$, and the normalized SED at wavelength index
        \f$\ell\f$ corresponding to that cell, as obtained from the dust emission library. Once we
        know the luminosity \f$L_{\ell,m}\f$ emitted by each dust cell, we calculate the total dust
        luminosity, \f[ L_\ell = \sum_{m=0}^{N_{\text{cells}}-1} L_{\ell,m}, \f] and create a
        vector \f$X_m\f$ that describes the normalized cumulative luminosity distribution as a
        function of the cell number \f$m\f$, \f[ X_m = \frac{ \sum_{m'=0}^m L_{\ell,m'} }{ L_\ell
        }. \f] This vector is used to generate random dust cells from which photon packages can be
        launched. Now the actual dust self-absorption can start, i.e. we launch \f$N_{\text{pp}}\f$
        different photon packages at wavelength index \f$\ell\f$, with the original position chosen
        as a random position in the cell \f$m\f$ chosen randomly from the cumulative luminosity
        distribution \f$X_m\f$. The remaining life cycle of a photon package in the dust emission
        phase is very similar to the life cycle described in
        MonteCarloSimulation::runstellaremission(). */
