/** DustSystem is an abstract class for representing complete dust systems, including both a dust
    distribution (i.e. a complete description of the spatial distribution and optical properties of
    the dust) and a grid on which this distribution is discretized. There are specialized
    subclasses for use with oligochromatic and panchromatic simulations respectively. A DustSystem
    object contains a vector of dust cells, each of which contain all useful information on the
    dust within that particular piece of the configuration space. Furthermore, a DustSystem object
    contains pointers a DustDistribution object and to a DustGrid object). A subclass may of course
    maintain additional information depending on its needs. */

        density (for every dust component) of all the cells. To calculate the volume of a given
        dust cell, we just call the corresponding function of the dust grid. To calculate and set
        the density corresponding to given dust component in a given cell, a number of random
        positions are generated within the cell (see sampleCount()). The density in the cell is
        calculated as the mean of the density values (found using a call to the corresponding
        function of the dust distribution) in these points. The calculation of both volume and

        to broadcast the densities of the dust cells assigned to a particular process to all other
        processes and storing them in the appropriate place in the container. This is implemented
        as an element-wise summation of this container across all processes, where the density for
        a particular dust cell and dust component will be added to a series of zeros, coming from
        the processes that were not assigned to that dust cell. The end result will be an assembly
